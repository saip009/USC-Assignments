### Overview
In this assignment you will write a naive Bayes classifier to identify hotel reviews as either true or fake, and either positive or negative. You will be using the word tokens as features for classification. The assignment will be graded based on the performance of your classifiers, that is how well they perform on unseen test data compared to the performance of a reference classifier.
